# pollardRhoDiscreteLogJava
pollard rho Implementation in Java

The Code is either in "Main.java" or in "src/pollardRhoDiscreteLogJava/Main.java"

Code is Documented

You have given G(Generator) S(solution) and P (Prime)
and look for G^x mod P = S

This Algorithm calculates X via Pollard rho Pathfinding Stuff
